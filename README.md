# B+ Tree Parts Catalog System
The B+ Tree Parts Catalog System is a Java-based project that provides a single-user system for storing, viewing, and manipulating a PART CATALOG without using a traditional database. Instead, it utilizes a B+ tree to store the parts data, with the leaf nodes containing the actual data.

## Project Overview
The project consists of two main parts:

- *User Interface*: Allows users to access and manage the parts catalog stored in the B+ tree. Users can view, maintain, and modify the catalog through the interface.

- *B+ Tree*: Stores the collection of data, including parts values and descriptions, in its leaf nodes. The B+ tree implementation provides efficient storage and retrieval of data.

These two parts are designed to be independent of each other, making it easier to enhance and extend the functionality of the system in the future.

## Features
- Single-user system for managing a parts catalog.
- Uses a B+ tree for efficient storage and retrieval of parts data.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the parts catalog.
## Technologies Used
Java
## Getting Started
To run the B+ Tree Parts Catalog System, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Compile and run the Java code.
- Use the provided user interface to manage the parts catalog.
## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple users and concurrent access.
- Integrate with a database for scalability and data persistence.
